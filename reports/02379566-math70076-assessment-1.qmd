Amidst the swift changes sweeping across the globe, a subtle but significant shift is occurring within the sphere of American education. By utilizing data collected from The Washington Post, we gain insight into the growing trend of homeschooling across various states. Over a span of six years, a clear pattern emerges in twenty-nine statesâ€”a significant rise in homeschooling enrollment, especially between 2019 and 2020. While only six states are highlighted (California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Virginia, and Kentucky), other states represented by the grey line also exhibit similar trends.This surge, indicative of changing attitudes, suggests a return to home-based education. There are speculations that the rise coincides with the outbreak of COVID-19, which began to make its mark at the turn of 2019, hinting at a potential connection. The pandemic, which disrupted traditional schooling methods globally, unintentionally led to a shift towards home-based learning, where kitchen tables served as classrooms and parents assumed the role of educators.

Focusing specifically on the district level in the United States, we utilize the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to gauge the growth of homeschooling over the past six years. CAGR provides a smoothed-out growth rate over multiple years, helping to balance out the impact of unusual events like the COVID-19 pandemic on homeschooling enrollments. Presented in two circular bar charts, the CAGR percentages range from -50 to 50, while the growth rates for the exceptional year span twice that range. Despite the dramatic surge observed in 2019, the overall trend indicates fluctuations in home education rather than a consistent increase or decrease. Overall, while homeschooling has seen a slight increase in most states or districts, it hasn't grown as rapidly as it did in 2019. It may require additional years of data to determine if there are significant shifts occurring in American education.
