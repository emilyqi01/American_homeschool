# Summarise the style guidelines that are relevant to your submission

My plots should follow the style guideline for the web version in Economist. 

# Clearly state which guidelines are and are not met
What I met:
- Background of the three plots all follow the new version, which is white.
- The size of all titles and subtitles are set to the correct size
- The color for both line plot and bar plot follows the palette and palette's orders.
- The Source text is set to 75% black
- I have set the major grid lines and the grid x lines with the correct color and thickness for the line plot.
- Also, I have tried to add the red box which is the representation for a graph in Economist

What I did not meet:
- The font size may not meet the requirement as R does not have the specific Econ sans style.
- The graph should not have a margin for the new web version, unfortunately, due to time limit, I did have time to adjust it.
- The size of the plots may not fulfill the requirements.
- The circular bar chart may not meet requirements for its legends as there is no example style for such plot.
