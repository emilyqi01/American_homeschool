## Summarise the style guidelines that are relevant to your submission
My plots should follow the style guideline for the new web version in Economist.
All the charts should follow the required size and the text inside also follow the font size.
The chart types I used are the bar plot and the line plot. Thus both of the plots should follow the color and the order of palette.
Also, since it is for Economist, the representative tag(red square) is needed for each plot.
## Clearly state which guidelines are and are not met
What I met:
- Background of the three plots all follow the new version, which is white.
- The size of all titles and subtitles are set to the correct size
- The color for both line plot and bar plot follows the palette and palette's orders.
- The Source text is set to 75% black
- I have set the major grid lines and the grid x lines with the correct color and thickness for the line plot.
- Also, I have tried to add the red box which is the representation for a graph in Economist

What I did not meet:
- The font size may not meet the requirement as R does not have the specific Econ sans style.
- The graph should not have a margin for the new web version, unfortunately, due to time limit, I did have time to adjust it.
- The size of the plots may not fulfill the requirements.
- The circular bar chart may not meet requirements for its legends as there is no example style for such plot.
## Describe any alterations you would make to your submission with the assistance of the magazineâ€™s team of experienced data journalists.

- The main alterations for plots are the size adjustments and margin adjustments.
- Since the data collection for states or districts are not in the same way, there might be bias when doing data analysis, analyzing the uncertainty of the growth rate will be helpful. 
- Due to time limit, I only roughly calculate states growth rate and select few of the districts to analyze. However, interestingly, the district can also split to types including public school, independent school, county school or city school. Further collection and exploration over the data is needed.
