## Summarise the style guidelines that are relevant to your submission
My plots should adhere to the style guidelines for the new web version of The Economist. All charts conform to the specified sizes, and the text within them also matches the required font size. I utilized two types of charts: the bar plot and the line plot. Consequently, both plots should align with The Economist's color scheme and palette sequence. Furthermore, given these visuals are for The Economist, a representative tag (a red square) is necessary for each plot to maintain brand consistency.
## Clearly state which guidelines are and are not met
What I met:
- All three plot backgrounds are white, aligning with the new version.
- Titles and subtitles are correctly sized.
- Line and bar plots use the prescribed palette colors in order.
- Source text is colored 75% black.
- Major grid lines and X-axis lines in the line plot have the proper color and thickness.
- A red square tag is included for brand consistency.

What I did not meet:
- Font might not match requirements due to R's lack of Econ sans style.
- Graphs retain margins against guidelines due to time constraints.
- Plot sizes may fall short of specifications.
- The circular bar chart's legends lack a style example, possibly not meeting standards.
## Describe any alterations you would make to your submission with the assistance of the magazineâ€™s team of experienced data journalists.

- The main alterations to the plots include size and margin adjustments.
- Since data collection methods for states or districts vary, there may be bias in data analysis. Analyzing the uncertainty of the growth rate will be helpful.
- Due to time constraints, I have only roughly calculated state growth rates and selected a few districts for analysis. Interestingly, districts can be categorized into types, including public schools, independent schools, county schools, or city schools. Further data collection and detailed exploration are needed.
